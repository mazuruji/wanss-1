  <br />
  <h2 class="Header"> Dear members of the World Academy of Nursing Science (WANS)</h2>
<br />
<td ><p> I am delighted to send you best wishes from Thailand Nursing and Midwifery Council. At the outset I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all members for giving trust in me and elected me as the chairperson of WANS for the year 2022-2023 and for your continuing support of WANS in strengthening the academic and research collaboration in nursing science. </p></td>
</tr>
<br />
<td ><p> As WANS aims to connect with nurse scientists, nursing scholars, and practitioners around the world to share their knowledge, expertise in our biannual research/academic conference, and to make a difference in the scientific community.  I therefore urge you all to kindly engage more nursing organizations with the same goal as WANS to be members of WANS.   </p></td>
<br />
<td ><p>Due to COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts, accessibility to health care service and the efforts to accelerate the achievement of Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals are disrupted.  Work and quality of life of nurses are also affected tremendously globally. More evidence to guide the practices and inform policy decision making are critical to optimizing health system performance and health-related outcomes for people.  I, therefore, invite nurse researchers in our WANS network to generate more evidence and innovations to enhance quality of nursing education, leadership and service and to formulate policies to increase investment in responding to the Global Nursing and Midwifery Strategic Directions, 2021-2025 and the Global Strategy on Human Resource for Health 2020-2030.  </p></td> 
<br />
<td ><p>I envision the strong research networking, collaborative research approach, mutual benefit, and lasting relationships remain as the working culture of WANS.</p></td>
<br />
<td ><p>Lastly, I am honored to welcome all of you to visit new WANS website. You could access the website at https://www.tnmc.or.th.  You are encouraged to use this platform as one of the channels to connect, coordinate, collaborate and strengthen our relationship and networking.   In the website you will also find the information on the first Webinar to be organized by Japan Academy of Nursing Science on “Early researcher's experience during COVID-10 pandemic” on 9 August 2022.  Please disseminate the posters to related institutions and invite young researchers to attend. </p></td>
