<h3>A Word of Thanks</h3>
<p class="mb20">The First International Nursing Research Conference of the World Academy of Nursing Science in Kobe was a great success, attended by about 860 participants from 20 countries on September 19-20, 2009. In addition to the keynote speeches, symposiums, and an information exchange program, the First International Nursing Research Conference included Oral Presentations on 82 topics in 23 groups, and the Poster Sessions covered 351 topics in 65 groups. Participants enjoyed the Conference, passing on comments such as �It was a good opportunity to socialize with researchers from other countries�, and �It was an excellent conference�.
<br />
<br />
The success of the conference was due to the many people who provided support. My sincerest thanks go to everyone in the 16 organizations that are the inaugural founding members of the World Academy of Nursing Science, to the organizations that made donations, to the keynote speakers, to the symposium presenters, to the moderators chairing each session, and to everyone else working behind the scenes.
<br />
<br />
The management of this First International Nursing Research Conference was conducted by the Japan Academy of Nursing Science, the Planning members, the Operation members, the Implementation members, and university undergraduate and graduate student volunteers, a total of some 130 persons. I was greatly impressed by the power and energy produced when people work together.
<br />
<br />
I would also like to thank all those people who witnessed the historical moment of the establishment of the World Academy of Nursing Science and the holding of the First International Nursing Research Conference. I will be very happy if for everyone involved in this conference it has provided impetus for the further development of nursing science and is a source of energy to face the new challenges of tomorrow.
In two years, the Second International Nursing Research Conference will be held in the United States. Let�s all meet again there!
<br />
<br />
Aiko Yamamoto,<br />
Chairperson,<br />
The First International Nursing Research Conference
of the World Academy of Nursing Science </p>
